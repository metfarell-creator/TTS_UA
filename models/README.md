# Models Directory

This folder will hold the Hugging Face snapshots that are downloaded automatically
by the application or the installer. The subdirectories correspond to the
repositories configured in `config.yml`, for example:

- `models--skypro1111--mbart-large-50-verbalization`
- `models--patriotyk--styletts2_ukrainian_multispeaker`
- `models--patriotyk--styletts2_ukrainian_single`

If you already have the checkpoints cached elsewhere, you can copy them here to
skip the initial download.
